Hari Sekhon Python Library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/harisekhon/pylib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/harisekhon/pylib) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/harisekhon/pylib/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/harisekhon/pylib?branch=master)
==========================

My personal libraries, full of lots of validation code and utility functions.

Only supports Python 2 for now.

#### Build + Unit Tests ####

```
make &&
make test
```

Continuous Integration is run on this repo to build and unit test it (PyUnit).

#### Configuration ####

Strict validations include host/domain/FQDNs using TLDs which are populated from the official IANA list, a snapshot of which is shipped as part of this project.

To update the bundled official IANA TLD list with the latest valid TLDs do
```
make tld
```
##### Custom TLDs #####

If using bespoke internal domains such as ```.local``` or ```.intranet``` that aren't part of the official IANA TLD list then this is additionally supported via a custom configuration file at the top level called ```custom_tlds.txt``` containing one TLD per line, with support for # comment prefixes. Just add your bespoke internal TLD to the file and it will then pass the host/domain/fqdn validations.
